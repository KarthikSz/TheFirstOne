praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism.', '[9][10] george r.r.', 'martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis

true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and dark lords, but from ourselves.', '\"[14]\\n\\na common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which martin says does not mirror the real world.', \"[15] just like people's capacity for good and for evil in real life, martin explores the questions of redemption and character change.\", '[16] the series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story.', '[13][17] benioff said, \"george brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy.', 'he introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe.', '\"[13]\\n\\nin early seasons, under the influence of the a song of ice and fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers.', '[18] in later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to game of thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.', '[18] the series also reflects the substantial death rates in war.', '[19][20]\\n\\ninspirations and derivations\\nalthough the first season closely follows the events of the first novel, later seasons have made significant changes.', 'according to david benioff, the series is \"about adapting the series as a whole and following the map george laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way\".', '[21]\\n\\nthe novels and their adaptations base aspects of their settings, characters, and plot on events in european history.', '[22] most of

the english wars of the roses[24] (1455–85) between the houses of lancaster and york, reflected in martin's houses of lannister and stark.\", 'the scheming cersei lannister evokes isabella, the

long as the lord of the rings, which had been adapted as three feature films.', '[37] similarly, benioff also said that it would be impossible to turn the novels into a feature film as the scale of the novels is too big for a feature film, and dozens of characters would have to be discarded.', 'benioff added, \"a fantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a pg-13 rating.', 'that means no sex, no blood, no profanity.', 'fuck that.', '\"[13] martin himself was pleased with the suggestion that they adapt it as an hbo series, saying that he \"never

artistic choice: \"we\\'re trying to be as naturalistic as possible\".', '[250][251] the criticism reached a high point during \"the long night\", the third episode of season 8.', '[252][253] barely minutes into the episode, viewers took to social media sites such as twitter to express their discontent about the fact that they were having severe difficulties watching the battle and trying to figure out what was going on.', '[254][255][256][257]\\n\\nsex and violence\\ndespite its otherwise enthusiastic reception by critics, game of thrones has been criticized for the amount of female nudity, violence, and sexual violence (especially against women) it depicts, and for the manner in which it depicts these themes.', 'the atlantic called the series\\' \"tendency to ramp up the sex, violence, and—especially—sexual violence\" of the source material \"the defining weakness\" of the adaptation.', \"[258] george r. r. martin responded that he feels obliged to be truthful about history and human nature, and that rape and sexual violence are common in war; and that omitting them from the narrative would have rung false and undermined one of his novels' themes, its historical realism.\", '[14] hbo said that they \"fully support the vision and artistry of dan and david\\'s exceptional work and we feel this work speaks for itself.', '\"[14]\\n\\nthe amount of sex and nudity in the series, especially in scenes that are incidental to the plot, was the focus of much of the criticism aimed at the series in its first and second seasons.', 'stephen dillane, who portrays stannis baratheon, likened the series\\' frequent explicit scenes to \"german porn from the 1970s\".', '[259] charlie anders wrote in io9 that while the first season was replete with light-hearted \"sexposition\", the second season appeared to focus on distasteful, exploitative, and dehumanizing sex with little informational content.', \"[260]\\n\\naccording to the washington post's anna holmes, the nude scenes appeared to be aimed mainly at titillating heterosexual men, right down to the brazilian waxes sported by the women in the series' faux-medieval setting, which made these scenes alienating to other viewers.\", '[261] the huffington post\\'s maureen ryan likewise noted that game of thrones mostly presented women naked, rather than men, and that the excess of \"random boobage\" undercut any aspirations the series might have to address the oppression of women in a feudal society.', '[262] saturday night live parodied this aspect of the adaptation in a sketch that portrayed the series as retaining a 13-year-old boy as a consultant whose main concern was showing as many breasts as possible.', '[260][263]\\n\\nin the third season, which saw theon greyjoy lengthily tortured and eventually emasculated, the series was also criticized for its use of torture.', '[264] new york magazine called the scene \"torture porn.', '\"[265] madeleine davies of jezebel agreed, saying, \"it\\'s not uncommon that game of thrones gets accused of being torture porn—senseless, objectifying violence combined with senseless, objectifying sexual imagery.\"', 'according to davies, although the series\\' violence tended to serve a narrative purpose, theon\\'s torture in \"the bear and the maiden fair\" was excessive.', '[266]\\n\\na scene in the fourth season\\'s episode \"breaker of chains\", in which jaime lannister rapes his sister and lover cersei, triggered a broad public discussion about the series\\' depiction of sexual violence against women.', 'according to dave itzkoff of the new york times, the scene caused outrage, in part because of comments by director alex graves that the scene became \"consensual by the end\".', 'itzkoff also wrote that critics fear that \"rape has become so pervasive in the drama that it is almost background noise: a routine and unshocking occurrence\".', '[14] sonia saraiya of the a.v.', 'club wrote that the series\\' choice to portray this sexual act, and a similar one between daenerys targaryen and khal drogo in the first season—both described as consensual in the source novels—as a rape appeared to be an act of \"exploitation for shock value\".', '[267]\\n\\nin the fifth season\\'s episode \"unbowed, unbent, unbroken\", sansa stark is raped by ramsay bolton.', 'most reviewers, including those from vanity fair, salon, the atlantic, and the daily beast, found the scene gratuitous and artistically unnecessary.', '[258][268][269][270] for example, joanna robinson, writing for vanity fair, said that the scene \"undercuts all the agency that\\'s been growing in sansa since the end of last season.', '\"[271] in contrast, sara stewart of the new york post wondered why viewers were not similarly upset about the many background and minor characters who\\'d undergone similar or worse treatment.', '[272] in response to the scene, pop culture website the mary sue announced that it would cease coverage of the series because of the repeated use of rape as a plot device,[273] and us senator claire mccaskill said that she would no longer watch it.', '[274]\\n\\nas the sixth and seventh seasons saw daenerys, sansa, and cersei assume ruling positions, alyssa rosenberg of the washington post noted that the series could be seen as a \"long-arc revenge fantasy about what happens when women who have been brutalized and raped gain power\"—namely, that their past leaves them too broken to do anything but commit brutal acts in their own turn, and that their personal liberation does not affect the social change needed to protect others from suffering.', '[275] time reported before the seventh season that \"even if benioff and weiss don\\'t always admit it, the show has changed.', 'scenes in which exposition is delivered in one brothel or another, for example, have been pared back\".', \"[276]\\n\\nfandom\\nmain article: a song of ice and fire fandom\\npresident obama sits on the iron

iron throne in the oval office with the king's crown on his lap.\", 'the popularity of the show in the country, coupled with its filming locations in northern ireland, led to the creation of a show-specific exhibit in the national wax museum plus in dublin.', 'a song of ice and fire and game of thrones have a broad, active international fan base.', \"in 2012 vulture.com ranked the series' fans as the most devoted in popular culture, more so than lady gaga's, justin bieber's, harry potter's or star wars'.\", \"[277] fans include political leaders such as former us president barack obama,[278][279] former british prime minister david cameron,[280] former australian prime minister julia gillard[281][282] and dutch foreign minister frans timmermans, who framed european politics in
